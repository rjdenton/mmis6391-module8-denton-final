Module8 - Final Project

I added Edamam API to my project. This API will sort through the ingredients and give the nutritional information for the listed ingredients. If the ingredients are not clear (cheesy nachos since no amounts of 
ingredients were identified), it will notify the information is not available. I chose this API since it was an automatic function that could decipher the information given and calculate the nutritional 
information for the user to let them know the range of calories for each meal. If someone is looking at recipes, they more than likely are also interested in how good/bad 
that recipe may be for you. This allows for better knowledge of each recipe for users as the one creating the recipe may not know how to calculate the data.
